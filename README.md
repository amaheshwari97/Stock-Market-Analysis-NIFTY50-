# Stock-Market-Analysis-NIFTY50-
Stock market data is widely analyzed for educational, business and personal interests.
## Content
The data is the price history and trading volumes of the fifty stocks in the index NIFTY 50 from NSE (National Stock Exchange) India. All datasets are at a day-level with pricing and trading values split across .cvs files for each stock along with a metadata file with some macro-information about the stocks itself. The data spans from 1st January, 2000 to 30th April, 2021.

## Update Frequency
Since new stock market data is generated and made available every day, in order to have the latest and most useful information, the dataset will be updated once a month.
